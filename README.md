# fa-user-migration-tool

I don't really have instructions here, sorry. Look up how to install custom Chrome extensions. Oh, and make sure you're logged into your **new** account.

This Chrome extension web scrapes Fur Affinity from within your browser and attempts to migrate your old user content to a new username. This makes it highly dependent on how the FA website's HTML looks like at the time of running.

I've sent it to one friend in the last year and he was able to get through some errors, but... no guarantees. Give it a try and see if this helps you through the painful process of changing usernames!
